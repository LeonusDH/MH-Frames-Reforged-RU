		<label>Vacuum Noble Frame</label>
		<description>A plasteel chassis framework almost completely concealed by ornately carved patterns of inlaid jade and precious metals. Every part of it exquisitely and precisely etched, carved, and designed to meet the most refined and noble beauty standard possible. The underlying plasteel exposed only where it may strategically enhance the regal bearing imparted by the frame. The complexity of the decoration wastes many materials during construction, but the bulk and required quality of the framework also imparts some resistance to damage.\n\nThis top-end spacer framework also allows one to operate indefinitely in vacuum. This is achieved with distributed heat pumps to concentrate hot coolant into mirror-backed channels to radiate away excess heat without air exchange, though, this does make insufficiently heat-resistant clothing very impractical to wear.</description>

		<description>Replaces the chassis frame of this unit with a noble frame, accentuating beauty and presence, imbuing an incomparably regal bearing. Installing the frame is as much up to the components as to the artistic skills of its installer, as there is no way to standardize the beauty of the intricate design.</description>
