*Make sure there are no existing jobs, hediffs, or frames and (as always) employ [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2921585989]Mid-saver Saver[/url] to remove in the safest way possible.

This mod reworks a few existing frames for engineering consistency, tweaks the tech tree and unlock points, and adds a variety of extras.

Also includes code to ensure that the carrying capacity improvements from framework upgrades are applied to weight limits for all purposes including caravans.

[b]Altered Frames:[/b]
- Hydraulic (fixed carrying capacity bonus due to limitations of hydraulic actuators)
- Refined (increased pawn beauty and flat social impact buff from looking nice)
- Mobility (fixed movement speed bonus, again due to actual actuator functioning)

[b]Added Frames:[/b]
- Standard:
 - Noble Frame (more refined version of the Refined Frame with a focus on enhancing Nobility)
- Industrial:
 - Alignment Frame (hauling frame ideal for trainable mechanical animals)
 - Advanced Alignment Frame (improved from above but spacer tech and much more expensive)
 - Advanced Hydraulic Frame (as above; same scope of improvements and tech/cost changes)
- Military:
 - Thermal Pumped Frame (combat oriented upgrade to the Guardian Frame)
 - Martial Frame (combat durability enhanced upgrade to the Mobility Frame)
 - Multithermal Composite Frame (advanced hybrid of the Composite and Guardian Frames)
 - Martial Composite Frame (advanced hybrid of the Composite and Mobility Frames)
 - "Valiant" Multicomposite Frame (direct and expensive upgrade to the Composite Frame)

I am happy to add other unique frames if people want them.

[b]NEW FEATURE - SOS2 COMPATIBILITY:[/b]
- Vacuum-safe frame upgrades of advanced frames:
 - Noble Vacuum Frame
 - Sanitary Vacuum Frame
 - Alignment Vacuum Frame
 - Hydraulic Vacuum Frame
 - Multithermal Vacuum Frame
 - Martial Vacuum Frame
 - "Valiant" Vacuum Frame

 ALL Vacuum frames come with a range of additional stat effects for being vacuum-proof.

[h1]Incompatibilities:[/h1]
[list]
[*]No known incompatibilities.*
[/list]

[u]The following mods are special cases:[/u]
*EdB Prepare Carefully eventually breaks all custom pawns; but that's their problem.
*Combat Extended does their own compatibility patches; this is fine if they're patched for ATR.

[b]Can this be patched to work with -insert mod-?[/b]
[i]If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I may make patches if they're easy, but I won't be doing any messy patches myself though.[/i]

[b]Will you add the other localisations for other languages?[/b]
[i]As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.[/i]
